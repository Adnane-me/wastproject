# Skip Selector - Responsive React App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to choose the right skip (waste container) size based on real-time data from an external API.

## ðŸš€ Main Features

- Dynamic loading of skip options based on location
- Clear display of size, price, VAT, and usage options
- Selection modal to confirm the chosen skip
- User-friendly design with icons and intuitive layout
- Fully responsive interface adapted for both desktop and mobile screens

## ðŸ“± Mobile Adaptation

The application has been optimized for mobile devices using a combination of:

- A custom hook to detect screen size
- Conditional rendering for better user experience on smaller screens
- Responsive CSS using media queries

These changes ensure the layout adjusts properly to various device sizes without breaking the interface or user flow.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- React (Create React App)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- CSS for styling and layout
- React Icons for visual enhancements

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

The app runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This project serves as a foundation for building skip booking or waste management platforms and can be extended with routing, user authentication, and payment systems.
